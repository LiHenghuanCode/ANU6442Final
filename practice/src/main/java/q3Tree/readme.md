The definition of a red-black tree contains a number of properties that must be satisfied after any operation on the tree. One of these properties is:

> **Property 3:** All simple paths from any node x to a descendant leaf have the same number of black nodes.

Implement a function in Red-Black Tree with signature `public boolean testProp3()` to check if property 3 holds. You can define additional methods if you need.
